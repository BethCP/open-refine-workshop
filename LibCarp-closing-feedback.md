### Closing feedback

From learning to passing on...

Please briefly write on a sticky note the sorts of things you might need to go from learning software skills here to passing them on to your colleagues and peers in your daily practice.

Note:

- factors might be institutional, personal, skills related, et cetera
- more money and more time is an acceptable answer!
- if you don't think you'd be able to, tell us!
- no names required
