1) Worked examples/case studies. 2) Incremental exercises
Knowing the data, how to extract the data from our lib. management system. Practice wth data I am familiar with - applying each week's lessons practically. TIME! How to chip away at OpenRefine during work - Quick wins to show it's worth it to the boss!
Not being discouraged to do things myself by/because of colleagues who can do these things by "just" scripting themselves
I'd be really keen but think I'd need time and actually apply this to something practically myself (I am hoping to do this) to feel more confident in it (+ seeing other people's practical applications too).
Access to notes off github. Any websites that act as a simple reminder for me + to give others
More Practice + Making Things/Using the Training! Organising skillshares/presentations/Tutorials to provide training and exchange/pass on skills. Develop Projects to use skills.
An appropriate channel: knowing the people/group to disseminate to
I need to job at a higher level to give me access to the data so I can play with it eg: analytics in Alma
I need admin access to my computer(!)
I need a little more time to 'play' with this to fully understand it all... However some of my colleagues are not very technologically adept, so not sure how much can pass on
Making time in day-to-day work
Might be able to sell OpenRefine to colleagues but the organisation I work for hates Open Source Software :(
I would like to have a course on coding if possible
I feel we opened pandora's box. I certainly need more time to practice and a community where I am not afraid of asking stupid questions. I would like to do more training.
Time, practice, ability to download software to training PCs
Biggest problem - my own skills/confidence. But if I could work on that then internal version of this could work well.
Lots of practice! Lots of time! (I'm a slow learner) Supper! Thank you :)
Practice exercises. Case studies.
